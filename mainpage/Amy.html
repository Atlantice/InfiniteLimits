						<p>
							Amy graduated from a private Christian school in 2001. 
							There were a little over 100 students in her graduating class. 
							She went on to study both Journalism and Political Science at Colorado State University 
							for several years before taking a break from academics to work full-time as a general 
							manager for Starbucks Coffee Company. Nearly 5 years later Amy started a family and 
							ended up in Jacksonville, NC with her two children and husband who is a Marine Corps Veteran. 
							She now aspires to become an elementary school educator and is nearly finished with the 
							prerequisites to be admitted into the UNCW Watson School of Education. 
							Amy has a diverse array of subjects she is interested in, but enjoys any class 
							where she is writing or learning to work with others, specifically students. 
							She knows what it is to balance a family, school and work life. 
							"Throughout my education I have learned that the single most valuable tool I have 
							is to ask for help." She takes advantage of online classes and many other on campus 
							resources and programs where she currently attends school at Coastal Carolina Community College.
